    <h1 className="title">About me</h1>
    <p className="text">
      I have worked in the luxury goods sales area for 6 years, at various positions, from
      a Sales Associate to a Supervisor, to an Assistant Manager. From those few years, I have
      learned the job itself, but also teamwork and its importance, building relationship
      with customers, complying with the processes of a big company. But most importantly, I have
      used that time to learn about me.
    </p>
    <p className="text">
      My experience in customer service as part of a team, but also my experience in different job
      positions offered me great assets that give me confidence and ease to build new relationships.
      Organizing the store, training the team members and following their growth, complying with
      the company's procedures, organizing events, creating lasting relationships with our customers
      were all part of my work. But within that, what I liked the most was facing the challenges and
      resolving them.

      In 2021, I seeked support from a professionnal retraining coach. It was time to challenge
      myself, to learn new things and develop myself.
      I started a Full stack web and web mobile developper training with <a href="https://oclock.io/formations/developpeur-web#programme" target="_blank" className="link" rel="noreferrer"> O'clock</a>. 
      I had no technical knowledge in web development but was fully convinced that I am made for it.
      During 3 months we learned to use <span>HTML/CSS</span>,
      <span>PHP</span> and <span>mySQL</span>, <span>JavaScript</span> and the <span>OOP</span>
      while manipulating <span>Git</span> with <span>GitHub</span>.
      We also had a glimpse of the power that
      a <span>CMS</span> like <span>Wordpress</span> could offer.
      I have then specialized myself in <span>React</span> for a month.
    </p>
    <p className="text">
      Our project, to conclude the training, was conceived with a team of 5 during a month.
      We worked together daily during 4 sprints.
      You can find our presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHnBAk1Bwrg&t=375s" target="_blank" className="link" rel="noreferrer">here</a> from 6min15 to 22min10.
    </p>
    <p className="text conclusion">
      I've learned a lot during this past year as a Full stack web developper and I'm still
      eager to learn the ocean of knowledge that lays ahead.
